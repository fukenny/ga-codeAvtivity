Using Javascript and JQuery we are able to access the JSON inside the Omdb API.

Step 1: Connect with OMdb service. Used JQuery.getJSON() to get initial 10 results.
Step 2: Layout of array elements. Created a variable that draws in the values from the JSON feed. This variable is then linked to a div in the body.
Step 3: Expand on the results. Used the imdbID field in the initial array to query the IMdb service for more detailed information.
Step 4: Add Foundation framework. Adjusted layout using HTML/CSS
